Vector3 and CFrame classes in pure Lua

These are a few "classes" (I use the term lightly) that I wrote for use in pure Lua. They are useful for anything 3D in gamedev or potentially mathematical. The CFrame class is used to store 3D positional/rotational data while the Vector3 class can be used in a similar fasion or for general mathematical usage.

The Vector3 class is independant and can run on its own in plain old Lua. The CFrame class needs the Vector3 class to run.

I originally posted this on my wiki page, but I wanted to have a copy on github in case it ever got deleted or whatever.
